*The project name*
Final Capstone

*A clear, short, and to the point description of your project. Describe the importance of your project, and what it does*

This projects is an in-depth PCA report of UsArrests.csv. It uses two clustering techniques to analyse the data. 

*A table of contents to allow other people to quickly navigate especially long or detailed READMEs.*

Not needed, here. 

*An installation section that tells other users how to install your project locally.*

Not sure what this involves. 

*A usage section that instructs others on how to use your project after theyâ€™ve installed it. 
Include screenshots of your project in action.*

I don't know if I can include screenshots here as I am typing this directly into github. I will do some investigating.

project if the project has been created by more than one person.*
